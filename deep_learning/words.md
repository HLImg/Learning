## Chapter-1

[words](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs)

1. Deep networks are the most **powerful** and **practical** machine learning models and are often **encountered** in day-to-day life.
2. It is **commonplace** to translate text from another language using natural language processing algorithm, to search the internet for images of a **particular** object using a computer vision systems, or to **converse with** a digital assistant via a speech recognition interface. 
3. The book is **neither** terribly theoretical **nor** extremely practical.
4. The reader will be able to apply deep learning to novel situations where there is no existing **recipe for success**.
5. cutting-edge methods:前沿方法
6. taxonomy:分类法 
7. two pixels above and below one another are closely related.
8. When we talk about training or fitting a model, we mean that we search through the family of possible equations relating input to output to find the one that describes the training data most accurately.
9. As we shall see in the next section, their outputs may also be very large
10. Figures **depict** three models where the output has a complex structure that is not so closely tied to the input.
11. In principle, the latter three tasks can be tackled in the standard supervised learning framework, but they are more difficult for two reasons.
12. Constructing a model from input data without corresponding output labels **is termed** unsupervised learning;
13. Rather than learning a mapping from input to output, the goal is to describe or understand the structure of the data. 
14. Some generative models exploit the observation that data can be lower dimensional than the raw number of observed variables suggests.
15. It would be irresponsible to write this book without discussing the ethical implications of artificial intelligence. 
16. This potent technology will change the world to at least the same extent as electricity.
17. However, it remains unknown whether it is possible to build complex decision-making systems that are fully transparent to their used or even their creator.
