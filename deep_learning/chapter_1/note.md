### Introduction

Machine learning methods can coarsely divided into three categories as follows.

1. **Supervised learning**:  We define the models to learn a mapping from real-world inputs to expected predictions. We focus on the inputs and outputs and treat the model as a black box that **ingests** a vector of numbers and returns another vector of numbers.

2. **Unsupervised learning**: Constructing a model from input data without corresponding output labels is termed unsupervised learning. 

   1. **Generative modeling**: The models learn to synthesize new data examples that are statistically indistinguishable from the training data.

      -  Some generative models explicitly describe the probability distribution over the input data and here new examples are generated by sampling from this distribution.

      - Others merely learn a mechanism to generate new examples without explicitly describing their distribution.

   2. **Latent variables**: Some (but not all) generative models exploit the observation that data can be lower dimensional than the raw number of observed variables suggests. We can describe each data example using a smaller number of **underlying latent variables**. The role of deep learning is to describe the mapping between latent variables and the data. *The latent variables typically have a simple probability distribution by design*.

      We can interpolate between these examples by interpolating between their latent representations and mapping the intermediate positions back into the data space.

3. **Reinforcement learning**: The agent lives in a world can perform certain actions at each time step. The actions change the state of the system but not necessarily in a deterministic way. Taking an action can also produce rewards, and the goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn to **choose actions that lead to high rewards** on average.
